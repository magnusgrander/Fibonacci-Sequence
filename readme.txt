The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example,
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, …

Mathematically we can describe this as:
xn= xn-1 + xn-2

Many sources claim this sequence was first discovered or "invented" by Leonardo Fibonacci. The Italian mathematician, who was born around A.D. 1170, was initially known as Leonardo of Pisa. In the 19th century, historians came up with the nickname Fibonacci (roughly meaning "son of the Bonacci clan") to distinguish the mathematician from another famous Leonardo of Pisa.

There are others who say he did not. Keith Devlin, the author of Finding Fibonacci: The Quest to Rediscover the Forgotten Mathematical Genius Who Changed the World, says there are ancient Sanskrit texts that use the Hindu-Arabic numeral system - predating Leonardo of Pisa by centuries.

But, in 1202 Leonardo of Pisa published a mathematical text, Liber Abaci. It was a “cookbook” written for tradespeople on how to do calculations. The text laid out the Hindu-Arabic arithmetic useful for tracking profits, losses, remaining loan balances, etc, introducing the Fibonacci sequence to the Western world.

Rules for Fibonacci Numbers

The rules for the Fibonacci numbers are given as:

    The first number in the list of Fibonacci numbers is expressed as F0 = 0 and the second number in the list of Fibonacci numbers is expressed as F1 = 1.
    Fibonacci sequence numbers follow a rule according to which, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, where n > 1.
    The third Fibonacci number is given as F2 = F1 + F0. As we know, F0 = 0 and F1 = 1, the value of F2 = 0 + 1 = 1.
    The sequence of Fibonacci numbers goes like 0, 1, 1, 2, and so on.

The rule for Fibonacci numbers, if explained in simple terms, says that "every number in the sequence is the sum of two numbers preceding it in the sequence".
